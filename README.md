# Learning ReasonML: Chip's Challenge

A series of live streams in Norwegian of me exploring [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) by implementing something like [Chip's Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip%27s_Challenge). From almost not having tried it in the first episode, and hopefully by the end I'll be proficient in it. The streams are in Norwegian, but you can follow the progress in the commits, or just explore the code in this repo.
